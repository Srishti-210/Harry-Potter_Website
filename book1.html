<font color='gold'><b><h2>Plot</h2></b></font><br>
Harry Potter has been treated abusively by his aunt and uncle, Vernon and Petunia Dursley and bullied by their son Dudley since the death of Harryâ€™s parents ten years prior. This changes on his eleventh birthday, when a half-giant named Rubeus Hagrid delivers a letter of acceptance into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, after Vernon and Petunia destroyed previous ones. Harry learns his parents, wizards James and Lily Potter, were murdered by the most evil and powerful dark wizard, Lord Voldemort, and Harry was sent to the Dursleys as a baby. Voldemort lost his powers after failing to kill Harry, going into exile and making Harry famous among the hidden magical community.
<br><br>
Hagrid takes Harry to Diagon Alley, a hidden London street, introducing him to the wizarding world. Harry discovers his parents left him a fortune at Gringotts Wizarding Bank. He also receives a pet owl, Hedwig, school supplies, and a wand. A month later, Harry catches the Hogwarts Express from King's Cross railway station's secret Platform 9Â¾. On the train, he befriends fellow first-year Ronald Weasley, meets Hermione Granger, who the two initially dislike, and makes an enemy of first-year Draco Malfoy.
<br><br>
At Hogwarts, a magical Sorting Hat assigns the first-years to four Houses - Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw - that best suit their personalities. Ron tells Harry about Slytherin's reputation of housing dark wizards. Harry rejects the Hat's offer of Slytherin, which Draco joins, and is sorted into Gryffindor with Ron and Hermione.
<br><br>
Harry discovers he has a talent for flying on broomsticks and is recruited into his House's team for Quidditch as a Seeker. Harry dislikes the school's Potions master, Severus Snape, who favours Slytherin while seeking to fail Harry. Malfoy tricks Harry and Ron into risking expulsion by leaving their rooms at night. Hermione joins them, after failing to stop them, and, realising Malfoy's ruse, they run away, and discover a huge three-headed dog standing guard over a trapdoor in a forbidden corridor. Ron and Harry later save Hermione from a troll during the school's Halloween celebrations, and the three become best friends. Coupled with Snape's recent leg injury and behaviour, the event prompts Harry, Hermione, and Ron to suspect Snape of trying to enter the trapdoor.
<br><br>
Fearing the boys' expulsion, Hermione forbids them from investigating, directing Harry's attention to his first Quidditch game. His broomstick attempts to throw him off while mid-air, and Snape's strange behaviour during the match leads Hermione to suspect that he had jinxed Harry's broom. Christmas arrives and Harry receives an anonymous gift - his father's invisibility cloak. Using it to explore the school, he discovers the Mirror of Erised, which shows what the viewer most desires.
<br><br>
The trio find a newspaper report about an attempted robbery of a Gringotts vaultâ€”one that Hagrid had visited when helping Harry. They work out that the object kept under the trapdoor is a Philosopher's Stone, which grants its user immortality and the ability to turn any metal into pure gold. Harry is also informed by the centaur Firenze that Voldemort is plotting to steal the Stone to restore himself. When the school's headmaster Albus Dumbledore is lured from Hogwarts under false pretences, Harry, Hermione and Ron fear that the theft is imminent and descend through the trapdoor.
<br><br>
They encounter a series of obstacles, which force Ron and Hermione to stay behind while Harry goes ahead. Harry finds Quirinus Quirrell, the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, who reveals he had tried to kill Harry by jinxing his broom and letting a troll into the school, while Snape had been trying to protect Harry. Voldemort, whose face has sprouted on the back of Quirrell's head, is using Quirrell to attain the Philosopher's Stone. Harry is forced to stand before the final obstacle, the Mirror of Erised. It recognises Harry's lack of greed for the Stone and deposits it into his pocket. Quirrell attempts to seize the stone and kill Harry, but his flesh burns on contact with him. Harry's scar suddenly hurts and he passes out.
<br><br>
Days later, he awakens in the school's infirmary, where Dumbledore explains Harry's survival against Voldemort is due to a protective charm on Harry left by his mother's sacrificing her life for him. Quirrell's hatred and greed caused him to burn on contact with Harry, and he was abandoned to die by Voldemort. Dumbledore reveals he sent Harry the invisibility cloak, while the Stone has been destroyed. The school year ends with the final feast, during which Gryffindor wins the House Cup. Harry returns to Privet Drive for the summer, anticipating the holidays after neglecting to tell the Dursleys that the use of spells is forbidden by under-aged wizards.
